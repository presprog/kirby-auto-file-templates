> Delete this section after you are done.

This is our boilerplate for Kirby plugins. Create a project from this repository to create a new plugin and adjust the files accordingly:

```bash
# Adjust `my-new-kirby-plugin` to whatever you want to name the output folder
composer create-project presprog/kirby-skeleton-plugin my-new-kirby-plugin
```
1. Update `composer.json`:
* Update the package name
* Update the PSR-4 namespace (or remove entirely)
*  Update the installer name (or remove entirely)
2. Set the package name in `index.php`
3. Set the package name in `panel/index.js`
4. Add [badges](https://poser.pugx.org/), if you like
5. Write a proper `README.md` for your plugin
